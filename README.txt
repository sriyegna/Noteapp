There are two functions. add() and read().

read()
When you want to read a note, call the function "read()", and when prompted, enter the name of the person.
In the event a person does not exist in the database, you will be asked if you want to add it.
Acceptable answers are "y" for Yes, and "n" for No.

add()
When you want to add a note, call the function "add()", and when prompted, enter the name of the person.
In the event a person already exists, the note will be added after the pre-existing notes.
